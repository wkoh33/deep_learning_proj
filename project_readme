4. Setup anaconda env
- Find `init.sh` in project folder and run those comments line by line

5. Prepare Data on your environment
- Go to SlurmPrepData.sbatch
- Change line 10 and 15 to your gatech email
- `cd deep_learning_proj`
- `sbatch SlurmPrepData.sbatch`
    - This should trigger a batch job on the PACE cluster
    - https://ondemand-ice.pace.gatech.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/activejobs

6. PACE dashboard
- https://ondemand-ice.pace.gatech.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/files/fs/home/hice1
- Go to your own personal folder
- Files Tab to see your files in the server
- Data from step 5 should be in `scratch/data` folder

7. Train model
- Model is found in `libml/models.py`
- I've coded out the SqueezeNet but not sure if its correct
    - Never reached a completed training yet
- Go to `SlurmTrainModel.sbatch`
- Change line 14 and 19 to your gatech email
- Read the proper `README` to know what is happening
- `arch=squeezenet` or `arch=resnet` for the choice of model
- Feel free to tweak GPU at line 4 and time at line 10
- additional params found in `fixmatch.py`
- Model training will create checkpoint where subsequent training of same configs will continue from where the model training timeout

8. Model Eval
- Not reached this stage before
